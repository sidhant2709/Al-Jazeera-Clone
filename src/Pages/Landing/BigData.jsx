            The July 4 date is a new goal for the president, who has warned <br /> Americans of
            further pain and death from a virus that has already killed more than 530,000{' '}
            <br /> people in the United States, more than any other country <br /> in the
            world. Coronavirus-related lockdowns and restrictions have cost millions of <br />{' '}
            jobs. In a recounting of the toll the pandemic has taken on the nation, <br />{' '}
            Biden said: “Photos and videos from 2019 feel like they were <br /> taken in
            another era. The last vacation. The last birthday with friends. The last holiday{' '}
            <br /> with extended family.
